{"name":"Djachroum","content":"<h1>Djachroum</h1>\n<p>Ever since the old asteroid station in the Kandah Gap was rediscovered more than 30 years ago, it has had a dominant role in the Rimward Reach’s culture and politics. It is to Djachroum that desperate skippers set off to do their deal of a lifetime. Free thinkers, poets and mercenaries flock here to start a new life and leave old worries behind. Djachroum symbolizes the hope for a better life, unlimited opportunity or a second chance. But the road to fortune is never easy, and the Reach is a much less forgiving place than the prosperous civilization of the inner system. Djachroum is not a lawless station, but here there is no justice and life here is often violent and unforgiving to newcomers who do not know how to navigate its society. Many seekers of fortune fail, and they are lucky if they end up in the temple cave slum or dreaming away in some cheap orpor parlour. </p>\n<p>Djachroumi are generally hardened and cynical and easily distinguished from new arrivals, or Wabas as they are called (roughly translated as \"leaf chewers\", a derogatory word for Zenithians from Kua).</p>\n<p>It is also to Djachroum that spies, assassins, and agents flock from the whole Horizon, exchanging information, performing dark deeds, and making unholy covenants. Under the Akbar's leadership, the station is largely free from power-struggles of the other factions and that combined with its relative vicinity to Coriolis makes Djachroum one of the Third Horizon's most important spy nests. Above it all, the Founder's spirit hovers, the people who once built the station and then disappeared, seemingly into nothingness.</p>\n<h3>Djachroum Station</h3>\n<p><em>Population: </em><em>12,000 residents and approximately 2,000 visitors.

{"name":"Culture - TDB","content":"<p>Culture</p>\n<p>One might think that a station like Djachroum would have a poor cultural life, but then one would be wrong. In fact, Djachroum has a disproportionately great number of writers, poets, musicians, and artists. Many have moved away from prosecution, debt, or unrequited love to start over in the Rimward Reach - with mixed results usually, but it makes for a varied colony of artists here on the edge of the system.</p>\n<p>Music and Musical Theatre</p>\n<p>Music is serious business for the Djachroumi. Maybe it is not surprising that the two dominant music styles are extreme in their emotionally charged expression.</p>\n<p>Baria is the favourite genre of all lonely prospectors, sad and mournful ballads that deal with lost love, shipwreck, and the whims of the Icons. Its biggest star is Sani Sowal, the “Rose of Diachroum”. Her performances at the Governor's Palace are always sold out and Sowal's many romances are the hot gossip at Shamble's cafes. Other popular artists include the glamorous Aounorra from Coriolis and the Mahanla Sisters from Mira.</p>\n<p>Kabbah, on the other hand, is a dance-focused and tempo-rich music with roots in the native cultures of Kua, the Sogoi. The music is extremely popular at Djachroum especially thanks to the Governor's Palace which has become the obvious centrepiece in Djachroum's raucous nightlife. Popular kabbah artists and groups are Hala-hall, Moffutser and Djachroum's own pride Manja Gahn.</p>\n<p>In the Cave of the Hanging Bridges you can find Miss Sawas Theater, where ritualized Musical Theatre pays tribute to the rediscovery of the station. The plays praise Antoli Djachroum, the Akbar and the Rimward Reach in general and mock fake and petty Kuans to the riotous applause of a usually alcoholised audience. It is not uncommon for food scraps to be thrown at the stoic actors who have the misfortune to portray Kuans, a role often given to destitute and newly arrived wabas. Despite the residents' scepticism towards everything beyond Transshura, the Bulletin series “The Plantation Owner's Daughter” is immensely popular on Djachroum. Every evening, people gather around the holo-modules – from young trendy folks to aged and gnarled prospectors - to follow the family’s misfortune and quietly make fun of Kuan habits.</p>\n<p>Literature</p>\n<p>There are plenty of failed writers and poets on Djachroum. In the Shambles’ basaar, visitors can buy poems in their own honour for a few birr, or for a larger sum hire a writer to write a whole biography. Cheap tag novels are popular with the station's population and the writers are happy to supply stories about heroic nomads who trick greedy agents from the Colonial Agency. There is a considerable market in derivative fiction, taking characters from holonovels and weaving new stories – and unlikely relationships - around them.</p>\n<p>In recent years, an anonymous street poet known only as “The Poet” has become hugely popular, especially in the station's poorer neighbourhoods such as Ral-Kham. The Poet's subversive poems appear on house facades and cave walls and have a clear edge towards Akbar. The Purple Guard has arrested a number of imitators but so far the Poet has escaped their grasp.</p>\n<p>According to stubborn rumours, the great and notorious folk author Mazelman is on the station incognito. Of course, this has fired up curious correspondents and enthusiastic admirers. Is he working on a sequel to the masterpiece \"Stories from a Bygone Era\"? A considerable sum of birr from the Bulletin awaits anyone who finds the answer or even records an interview with him.</p>\n<p>News</p>\n<p>There are three main sources for news on Djachroum: The Bulletin, The Station Council and the Red Spider.</p>\n<p>The Bulletin as the Consortium's official news agency has a permanent correspondent on mainly factual, a little stiff in its delivery and gives the audience a sense of being independent and objective. However, the Bulletin’s (and Consortium’s) Kuan interests occasionally shine through and often conflict with the leadership of Djachroum, especially when it focuses on the Akbar's problems or perceived failings of the administration.</p>\n<p>The Station Council is the Akbar's official voice at the station and does not pretend to have any journalistic ambitions, spreading propaganda and practical public service messages without placing major demands on their audience’s intellect. The station council always writes the Akbar's version of the truth, which does not necessarily match what actually happened. The Red Spider is a legendary reporter who writes anonymously about everything that the Bulletin or the Station Council does not address - and then some.</p>\n<p>The Red Spider has a penchant for juicy gossip, hot romances and scandals and is more than happy to publish names of people based on nothing but conjecture, rumours and hearsay. The Red Spider is not driven by any obvious agenda in the same way as the other outlets but apparently has no major enthusiasm for diligent source checkin and might publish baseless gossip that apparently reveals widespread conspiracies and corruption.</p>\n<p>Holidays and Festivals</p>\n<p>Once every cycle, the Night of the Lights is celebrated, the most important holiday on the station. The Djachroumi light silk lanterns in the Cave of the Hanging Bridges and let them float up towards Sky Light in the roof of the cave. This act marks the beginning of a three-day party in rediscovery of the station and the repopulation of the Rimward Reach.</p>\n<p>The monkeys are Djachroum's jesters and leprechauns. They were there when Antoli Djachroum arrived at the station and despite several attempts to eradicate them, no-one has succeeded. Some believe that the monkeys are the Founders themselves, who got tired of the hard life in the Rimward Reach and changed their shape to please the Dancer. Once a year when the Dancer’s segment begins, Djachroumi gather to celebrate the Night of the Monkeys. The festivities might even beat the Night of the Lights and the Cycle celebration, if not in scope then in madness. During the Night of the Monkeys, nothing is considered forbidden. People dress up in extravagant costumes, fornicate and intoxicate with all sorts drinks and substances. The Akbar closes the space port during that night and no ships arrive or depart Djachroum. Thus, most ship crews join the throng with their joyful and beautiful young men and women (and some who are less so). During this night, the Purple Guard patrol carefully, as it is said that some of the sects in Ral-Kham are making plans to find people for their blood sacrifices among the revellers.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of Merchant's segment, all the Rimward Reach invades Djachroum as the Crickets Festival is celebrated. The name alludes to the nomads’ swarms using bio-sculpted crickets to detect radiation storms. No radiation sensor can beat a cricket in its sensitivity to radiation.</p>\n<p>During the festival, bio-sculpted crickets are sold in small cages and given away to others as tokens of good luck and happiness during the next cycle. In cycles gone by, they were just released in the Caves of the Hanging Bridges, until the Akbar banned this great Antoli Djachroum's honour and pays tribute to the Djachroum, who also draws on several freelancers. Agency news is particular practice because some crickets managed to get to the crops where they caused great damage.</p>\n<p>THE SHIRIM</p>\n<p>Among the colonists and nomads, the Shirim are iconic. These men and women are responsible for taking care of the family, the tribe, the swarm and interpret the will of the Icons. They act as leaders, advisors, counselors and carers for their people. Their most important function is to keep the songs alive, navigate the Reach, feed the people and keep the established order, be it of asteroids or swarms.</p>\n<p>Religion</p>\n<p>As in the rest of the Third Horizon, religion is an important part of the daily life of common man in the Rimward Reach. Except for some recent colonists, the people worship the nine Icons, though sometimes with other names and faces than the usual ones.</p>\n<p>Liturgy &amp; Worship</p>\n<p>The devotees at Djachroum worship the Icons daily. Usually this happens at home, but many also gather in one of the Icon temples or prayer alcoves, which are scattered around the station and along the winding stairs in the Cave of the Bridges. The official liturgy focuses on major events, such as marriage, sacrifices in the course of the year, and seeking blessings for important undertakings or travel in general. Every little temple is looked after by a priest, usually an Abba or Shirim, who takes take care of the temple and lives there. Visitors' gifts and donations are their livelihood.</p>\n<p>There is no single large association of all the priests, but the largest temples have formed a kind of canon, the “Five Doctrines”. This group provides official liturgical advice and has occasional contact with the Church of the Icons.</p>\n<p>OIKOUMENE AS NADJIM</p>\n<p>In recent years, a new question has arisen among philosophers and ministers in the Rimward Reach and at Djachroum. The question concerns the humanites' equality with “normal” people. The issue has been highlighted now that the clans are openly challenging the iconic beliefs of nomads and other colonists, calling their tolerance of humanites heresy.</p>\n<p>Prophet Ndina raised the issue in one of her sermons and the Five Doctrines (see above) were quick to take it up and create a new teaching for Nadjim, a new less condescending term for the humanites. There are now plans for an ecumenical meeting, “Oikoumene as Nadjim” (the ecumene or congregation of Nadjim), to affirm that there is no mental or spiritual difference between humanites and human beings. Invitations have gone out to famous priests, philosophers, and prophets in Third Horizon, but no date is set. The most likely date seems to be the Founding at the end of the Faceless’ segment.</p>\n<p>DJACHROUM’S APOSTLE</p>\n<p>When Djachroum was a new colony, missionary Char Kamran arrived from distant Mira. Char announced that he was sent by the Traveller to gather the people of Djachroum and the Reach under a new church. He showed a letter he himself penned under the Icon’s influence, a power of attorney that gave him the right to rule the station.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"uNLbT9f58U6kVeBg":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.b90UxD1u1p98UdnE"}},"_id":"MyjSjyjWVRNR4U0y"}
{"name":"Politics, Law and Order","content":"<h1>Politics, Law and Order</h1>\n<p>“Djachroum is the Akbar and the Akbar is Djachroum”, so the saying goes that the guards love to share with newly arrived wabas. As long as anyone can remember, the man known only as Akbar has ruled Djachroum and it is hard to overestimate the importance of the great leader for the prosperity and political power of the station in the Reach. Yet he is largely invisible to the inhabitants and keeps away from public events. On the rare occasions he ventures forth, the leader never leaves the dark sedan-chair he travels in. Why the Akbar doesn't want to show himself is of course subject of keen speculation, but even when discussing this in among friends in hushed voices, the conversations are kept short and cryptic - nobody wants a visit from the Purple Guard and generally, the population is satisfied with the state of things. The Akbar knows that the power of the station is dependent on the inhabitants' self-image as a free and unconquered people. As long as one does not violate any of Akbar's commandments, one is free to live one’s life as one wishes on Djachroum.</p>\n<p>The three-headed Station Council manages the station’s daily business. The Council consists of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The priest Kubar Nariman - known as one of the founders of the Five Doctrines (see section on religion) and for his unmatched collection of iconic relics from the whole Horizon. Nariman's origins are shrouded in secrecy, wicked gossip believes that the pious priest was once a simple prospector who lost his crew, and found the icons, in the darkness of the Kandah cloud.</li>\n<li>The Nasar prince Mahbod Gulbanû who, from his alabaster palace in the Captains’ quarter, controls large parts of Djachroum's trade and contracts with the Free League. Stubborn rumours claim that Gulbanû’s wealth is largely built on birr from the prospector clan Yimon's cash register. If that were true, it would be nothing short of scandalous, considering Djachroum's alliance with the Nomad swarms in the Marrab conflict.</li>\n<li>Sefraim Kann, the last member, and the most feared of all of them, is the commander of the Purple Guard. His reputation as bloodthirsty sadist may be exaggerated but after the massacre of the apostle Kamran and his disciples, no one is keen to put this to the test. The commander is said to have a great weakness for baria ballads and often visits the Governor's Palace’s Great Hall. Some say tears run down the warrior's cheeks when Sani Sowal sings.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Everyone on the council is loyal to the Akbar but that does not mean that the Council is free from conflict. It is an open secret that the Nasar Gulbanû does not tolerate the priest Nariman but under Kann's watchful gaze, neither of them dares interfere with the balance of the Council to promote their personal agenda.</p>\n<p>The Abkar reigns supremely on Djachroum, but he is no tyrant. The station's laws are few and draconically applied but otherwise leave inhabitants of Djachroum to live their lives in peace. Akbar's commandments, as the station's most important laws are called, are absolute and cannot be appealed. Prohibitions include the use of heavy weapons, sabotage of life support systems or the space port, entering forbidden areas and the use of certain words. Anyone violating such a commandment cannot expect mercy.</p>\n<p>The militia, or Purple Guard, are the Akbar's lawmakers and guardians. The organisation is more than 400 strong and maintains the Akbar’s rule in the station. An exception is the Machine Hall, where the mysterious Machinists themselves maintain the order. A third of the militia is traditionally nomadic in origin and selected from among the best warriors of the three swarms.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"uNLbT9f58U6kVeBg":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.mECVjBtog0YlogBa"}},"_id":"XszMrD7AKONNPF7f"}
