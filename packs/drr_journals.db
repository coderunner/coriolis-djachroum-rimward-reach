{"name":"Welcome to the Edge","content":"<h1>Welcome to the Edge</h1>\n<p>In the Sector of the Lady of Tears, beyond the outer edge of Transshura, stretches the Rimward Reach. For a long time, this was a forgotten place on the edge of the Kuan system. All that changed when one of the Foundation's long-range probes discovered something strange in depths of the Kandah Cloud. An expedition set off and found that the Rimward Reach had not always been deserted. Strange monuments and drifting shipwrecks testified to a time when colonists did not fear the great darkness.</p>\n<p>Now, many years later, the area is a gathering place for free thinkers and fortune seekers from all over the Horizon. But beneath the surface rages a ferocious struggle for the vast resources of the Reach. Here, on the edge of the Horizon, ragged prospectors, sneaky spies, and inquisitive archaeologists gather. They all hope to fulfil the dream of a better life. However, in the Reach there are few winners and many losers.</p>\n<p>In this supplement, you will find maps, texts and adventure ideas that will take you further into the Rimward Reach. The hope is that it will act as a contrast and a complement to Kua’s inner system and Coriolis itself.

{"name":"About this Translation","content":"<h1>About this Translation</h1>\n<p>A couple of years ago, I came across Coriolis and it immediately appealed to me. Having dabbled in Dangerous Journeys, Traveller and Space Gothic a long time ago, the vibe I was getting from Coriolis was what I wanted for stories I wanted to tell in the vein of Firefly, the Expanse and Elite. I liked the extra dimension the precursor culture offered, and the cataclysmic changes brought about by the Portal Wars. I started running the game at our local club. Soon, my players were looking for new areas to explore, away from Kua and Coriolis, and my mind turned to the Rimward Reach.</p>\n<p>As appealing as the Core Rulebook makes it sound, I wanted more detail – maps, story hooks, lore – that would flesh out the place and give me a smooth start. In my research, I came across a project by the original Coriolis creators called “Horisonten’s Ände” – Horizon’s End. The stated aim of this project was to provide an intriguing setting and a trilogy of stories that would flesh it out with plenty of story hooks to explore. I was intrigued, but quickly found out that these books had not ever been translated from Swedish. Well, I took that as a challenge.</p>\n<p>Although I do not actually speak Swedish, I knew enough to get to a workable translation for my group – and we had a blast! Judging by Free League’s Forum, Reddit, Discord and Facebook, there is still an appetite for the old tales of Sanningen Om SS-18, Ljusblommans Mörka Blåd and the article on Gränsrymden och Djachroum. Sanningen is already out there as “The Truth about Station 18”, this document is the second in the set and my translation of Ljusblommans / “The Lightflowers Dark Leaf” is almost done. With Free League’s kind permission – Iam / will be sharing them to contribute a little to the friendly and welcoming Coriolis Community.</p>\n<p>My translation started with a setting guide that originally appeared as a 20-page supplement in the Swedish RPG magazine Fenix (issue 2, 2010), but then Nils Karlén kindly sent me a copy of the full booklet that the article was expanded into, adding a good 15 pages to the source - it was a delightful translation challenge. I kept the original structure, which put information about the Reach in both halves of this document, first focusing on the place and then on the people with some overlap and repetition due to the genesis of the original. The text is dense with few illustrations and editing it was the work of many an evening, so please keep this in mind when you find the inevitable typos, inconsistencies, or mistranslations. I moved the Djachroum “personalities” to the end of the section from their original places around the book. Just as in the 2010 version, they are not fully “stat’ed out” and only list highlight skills, but you will find a couple of old acquaintances and good story hooks in their descriptions.</p>\n<p>So, enough on the vagaries of translations – it is time to dive into the Rimward Reach. I hope you find it an enjoyable read and - even more importantly - a useful quarry to build fun stories from. And judging by the references to Djachroum in “The Last Cyclade”, the Reach will gain importance!</p>\n<p><strong>May the Icons bless your Journeys! </strong></p>\n<p><em>PS – I included a plot hook “The Death of a Maskmaker” from Fenix 3/2010 as a bonus to the Djachroum section.</em></p>\n<p><em>Want to buy me a coffee?
