{"name":"Life in the Rimward Reach","content":"<h1>Life in the Rimward Reach</h1>\n<p>The inhabitants of the Reach generally see themselves as a unique people beyond the power games and intrigues of the Horizon. This is most noticeable in their complicated relationships with the power centre in Coriolis.</p>\n<p>In the Reach, everyone originating from inside the Transshura Belt is seen as Kuan. Life in the Reach varies greatly. Conditions are relatively comfortable at the larger stations (Djachroum, Nexis, Asmurid) with good access to life’s necessities and habitation space. On the smaller stations and settlements, it is primarily the living space that shrinks. In addition, some bionic modifications are often required for inhabitants to utilize the bases optimally. Many of the colonists are bionically modified with grip feet, extra micro hearts, vacuum resistance, specialized corneas, or other less noticeable modifications.</p>\n<h3>Food in Swarms and Astreroid Fields</h3>\n<p>Life on small ships, in narrow asteroid bases and as wanderers between oxygen oases is hard and precarious. It is essential to make full use of all resources and spaces, which can also be seen in Djachroum's many windows boxes and roof plantations. Even in the smallest nooks and crannies, spices, runner beans, vegetables and small fruit plants are cultivated. This need to be self-sufficient with hydroponic plants and small scale cultivations has also led most Nomads and colonists towards vegetarianism. Many look with disgust upon the consumption of meat, which is so foreign to them that it equates to a cultural taboo.</p>\n<h3>Prices in the Reach</h3>\n<p>The Reach counts as an Ordinary environment with certain elements of advanced technology, especially in the form of medical equipment, bionics, and cybernetics. Advanced technology is only available from some contacts in Djachroum. Some bionics (vacuum organisms and protective sculpts such as “weatherproof” scales) are common in the Reach, especially at Ahalimm.</p>\n<h2>Trade</h2>\n<p>The remote location of the Reach makes trade with the inner system extremely lucrative. Most settlements and bases are not self-sufficient in advanced technology, spare parts, and some unusual components. The exceptions are few, only some of the free colonists in the asteroid clusters consider themselves fully self-sufficient.</p>\n<p>In addition, there is always a need for luxury goods for the wealthier residents. In the Captain's Quarter of Djachroum, extravagant parties are not uncommon with delicacies and above all, meat products served, with both fashions and produce imported from the inner system.</p>\n<p>The vast distances within the sector of the Lady of Tears, which correspond to those in the entire inner system, are also an advantage to those transporting goods within it. The ships from the inner system arrive in Djachroum and then return straight away. Countless free traders take over their cargo from Djachroum and distribute goods between the many different asteroid settlements, relay bases and research enclaves. Free traders usually travel in convoy, preferably with lighter escort ships belonging to one of the countless free companies that are drawn to the Reach, attracted by the escalating Maghdan conflict and the increasing Corsair activity. Some free companies take on work from both sides and it is not uncommon for Free traders who refused expensive escort fees to fall victim to corsairs allied to the would-be protectors.</p>\n<h3>The Lost Convoy</h3>\n<p>Less than a segment ago, three sister ships departed from Djachroum. The Gavina, Heroda and Nefir headed towards a relay station near the sacred asteroid Marrab. The journey was estimated to take a little less than three weeks with planned stops at Nexis, Hraub and Nija, among others. Just after the departure from Hraub, they disappeared without a trace. No emergency signal, no wrecks or shipwrecks were found.</p>\n<p>At the same time, more traffic than usual was noted in the area on an outer flank of the swarm Mehtar. The swarm ships offered assistance with the search, but this was declined by the suspicious prospectors.</p>\n<h3>Oxygen Oases</h3>\n<p>Due to the long distances and the absence of accessible help, the oxygen oases of the Reach are crucial. They are usually located on asteroids, blasted into the regolith. Many are along the Song Lines, the routes Nomads and freighters use.The oxygen oases are usually just a small bunker or maybe a hollowed out hull with automated systems, emergency communicator and oxygen reservoirs. The oases were established by the Swarms and are sometimes based on self-generating vacuum organisms that can break the asteroid down into oxygen, energy and other vital substances. During the last three segments, there have been reports of vandalized oases, their walls were covered with alien and mysterious symbols. Most of the vandalised oases are in the vicinity of Karhal-7, Djachroum and the asteroid cluster near the segment of the Faceless. </p>\n<h3>Song Lines (aka Shirim Paths)</h3>\n<p>The Song Lines span right across the Rimward Reach, across the larger asteroids like Marrab, Hraub, Nija and Cresta. It is a network of routes between bases, oxygen oases, khaya gardens and settlements. They were created by the Shirim, storytellers and priests accompanying the first colonists, who sang to drive back the Darkness, anchoring asteroids and creating clear paths through space. To travel on the Song Lines is considered safe and to attack anyone on them is taboo, something which is not respected by all of the corsairs. At the same time some corsairs have suffered the curse of the abbot, bah-yiin, the star worm and the extinguisher, which is considered the destructive aspect of the Faceless.</p>\n<h2>Travelling</h2>\n<p>The large distances in the Reach mean that trips are long, laborious, and dangerous. It is important to make sure the ship you travel with is well equipped both with supplies and spare parts, that the hydroponic cultivators do not fail and that you do not get lost in a Hadra cloud. In case of emergency there is no help, unlike in the inner system with its many emergency beacons, listening posts and above all the shorter distances.</p>\n<p>Another problem in the Reach is the Kandah Cloud that divides the area into two parts. The only safe area to cross the cloud is via Djachroum and the Kandah Gap. Only the m ost desperate captains try to fly through the cloud. The detour around the far edges of the cloud is not profitable and the risk of being attacked by corsairs increases sharply.</p>\n<h3>Communication</h3>\n<p>Communication with the inner systems is mainly via Bulletin station Karhal-7. The station acts as a filter for information from the inner system. Most rich factions therefore buy information and communication services from fast couriers traveling from the inner system to Djachroum and some other bases. The Reach needs powerful communicators to get signals through gravel clouds and asteroids. Relay stations exist, but they are often sabotaged by corsairs.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"uNLbT9f58U6kVeBg":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.4HSZgSMIXBsEcTkh"}},"_id":"EXWko8WDaWfkMaID"}
{"name":"The Rimward Reach Today","content":"<h1>The Rimward Reach Today</h1>\n<p>The Reach is not dominated by any particular faction in the way the inner system is controlled by the Consortium. Due to the area’s inaccessibility, the factions' original disinterest and Djachroum’s strong position, it is now a melting pot for both smaller and larger groupings with conflicting interests.</p>\n<h2>The Free Station of Djachroum</h2>\n<p>Its strategic location in the Kandah Gap undoubtedly makes Djachroum the most important junction of the Reach. Under the guidance of its enigmatic Akbar (Rakiv Fatiman), the station has taken on the role of Reach’s capital and is its uniting force. This has not escaped the attention of the larger factions such as the Consortium and the Legion who seek to grow their presence and influence. Djachroum itself has a small militia, the Purple Guard, which patrols the station and the surrounding area and keeps the peace (mostly). For larger assignments, freelancers are often hired, and the station can thus muster considerable firepower in a short time.</p>\n<h2>Free League</h2>\n<p>The faction that has undoubtedly adapted best to the Reach’s intricate geopolitics is the plucky upstart of the Free League. The faction’s merchant ships and prospectors have long enjoyed good relationships with Djachroum, the Nomad swarms and the prospector clans. Its convoys from the inner system provide most of the area's luxury goods and technology. More recently, the convoys have been attacked by corsairs and it is not uncommon for convoys to lose one or two ships during the trip.</p>\n<h2>Nomad Swarms</h2>\n<p>The Reach’s three Nomad Swarms are not a unified faction. The nomads are largely self-sufficient and live on trade and simple prospecting. They have access to a large number of ships but have the disadvantage that they are scattered over the entire Reach, so that their permanent settlements are easily outnumbered by the new colonists.</p>\n<h3>THE SWARMS</h3>\n<p>Swarm is the nomadic term for a group of spaceships that have a common family affiliation. Normally a swarm is spread across several ships. It is also common for ships to leave the swarm for shorter trips, but it is rare for them to change swarms. The three swarms are the warlike Mehtar, the mysterious Badjao and the merchants of the Yahin-Kabu. The fourth swarm of Ahilar, said to have ties to the Founders, disappeared at the beginning of the Marrab conflict, following the destruction of Dakka 3.</p>\n<h2>The Consortium</h2>\n<p>While the Consortium was late to realise the potential of the Rimward Reach, it is now doing its level best to make up for its mistake. In recent years, the Consortium has strengthened its position significantly and is beginning to challenge Djachroum's power base by directing propaganda as well as lucrative trading and prospecting contracts to their supporters. Their most important bases in the area are the colonial agency's trading station Khea and the Karhal-7 Bulletin Station.</p>\n<p>Ironically, the Foundation, which is part of the Consortium, enjoys surprisingly good relations with Djachroum and even has some smaller outposts in the Reach, a fact that the Consortium's Special Section is keeping a close and suspicious eye on. The consortium does not have its own military presence in the region but relies on the Legion's forces for escort and patrol duties. With its fleet base at Thalus, built just over ten years ago, the Legion is a clear power factor. Its Reach Command is the area's strongest permanent military force, although it consists largely of small fighters and older torpedo boats. The Legion's ships are primarily active around the naval base, the Firstcome Armada and along the Colonial Agency's trade routes.</p>\n<h2>PROSPECTOR CLANS</h2>\n<p>The Clans, as they are referred to, are a group of recent prospectors from the inner asteroid belt who flocked to the Reach to mine for Maghdan. They are not the only prospectors in the Reach, but the only grouping with a reasonably uniform and coordinated agenda. The clans are free entrepreneurs who do not rely on financing from the Consortium. Considering their economic independence and the considerable firepower that the clans can raise, there is some suspicion of Syndicate involvement.</p>\n<h2>ASTEROID WALLAHS</h2>\n<p>In the void between denser asteroid clusters, small ships and reinforced exos silently move, often with a single crew member. These are the asteroid wallahs, These spacers live on herding asteroids rich in metal or minerals to the prospectors’ smelters. Wallahs almost never set foot in stations or bases and live in their small vessels. Many of them are humanites, biosculpted to cope with zero gravity and loneliness.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"modules/coriolis-djachroum-rimward-reach/images/relationship_matrix.png\" width=\"550\" height=\"295\" /></p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"uNLbT9f58U6kVeBg":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.coriolis-djachroum-rimward-reach.rimward_journals.BgbPrMcIVGfpgaOy"}},"_id":"OabwS9UCZGTX0c1w"}
{"name":"Space Phenomena and Dangers","content":"<h1>Space Phenomena and Dangers</h1>\n<p>In the Third Horizon, one does not simply travel through the emptiness of space. Space is full of hazards and the Reach is no exception. Not only is help terribly far away - if it is there at all-, the dangers are also more frequent and more deadly.</p>\n<h2>Hadra Clouds</h2>\n<p>The Reach is filled with gas clouds, a kind of nebulae in miniature. The Kandah cloud is the largest of them all and stamps its mark on the entire area as it divides the Rimward Reach.</p>\n<p>Although Kandah's gas cloud is dangerous with its many ion storms, the so-called Hadra clouds pose an equally dangerous obstacle to travel. The Hadra clouds are almost impossible to detect and flying into them causes navigation systems to fail partially or completely, leaving crews flying blind until they exit the cloud. The size of the clouds can vary from micro distances up to entire astronomical units.</p>\n<h2>Ion Storms</h2>\n<p>The Kandah cloud is known for its ion storms and they are one of the reasons no-one in their right mind tries to cross the cloud. The storms are believed to be more frequent in the depth of the cloud, but no one knows for sure. Several years ago, a group of small research vessels from Kander-Mall observatory vanished while examining the phenomenon in the depth of the cloud.</p>\n<p>When a ship enters an ion storm, discharges from the gas hit the ships hull, sending energy ripples right through a ship’s structure. Often this leads to system overloads, burned out sensors, failed communicators and, in the worst case, random activation of unprotected systems such as torpedoes or mines.</p>\n<p>The ion storms do not just stick to the gas cloud either. Skippers swear that large flashes of light have on several occasions lashed out like tentacles of electric lightning at ships passing near the gas masses in the Kandah Gap.</p>\n<h2>Black Birr</h2>\n<p>Although meteorites are rare around Kua, meteorite bursts occur quite frequently in the Reach. The worst kind is what skippers call “Black Birr”, lonely micrometeorites no larger than a single birr, yet nothing hits a ship with more devastating force. Captain Djadir Chartou is not just renowned for his corsair hunting but also because it is said that he himself was hit by black birr and survived. Not without a lot of bio-sculpting, say some.</p>\n<h2>Gravitational Eddies – “Tarns“</h2>\n<p>This close to the intersolar darkness, there are peculiar anomalies which are called Tarns by the common people and are now being investigated by the Kander-Mall Observatory. No one knows for sure what causes these eddies, but scientists have theories that they are breeding ground for black holes, something which has not been confirmed. Most people in the Reach stay clear of the Tarns, except the scientists and the nomadic Badjao swarm. Superstitious skippers tell of ships that have been sucked in with man, cargo and everything. Fortunately, the Tarns are located far away from the busier routes and clusters. Passers-by have reported that the Tarns seem to be expanding over time, a phenomenon the observatory chose not to comment upon.</p>\n<h2>Corsairs</h2>\n<p>A danger that does not have to do with the intriguing nature of the Reach is the accumulation of corsairs who increasingly haunt the area. The corsairs are usually lone ships, but lately they have become more organized small fleets that attack fixed installations, mining bases and even larger convoys.</p>\n<p>The two biggest corsair gangs are Akila's Rangers and Kompani Chike. Akila's Rangers are feared - according to rumour, they never take prisoners.</p>\n<h2>Dark-morphs and Vacuum Dwellers</h2>\n<p>As if natural phenomena and corsairs were not enough, the Reach also fears the Darkness between the Stars. So far from Kua's radiant glow, the Darkness leaks in. You should avoid longer trips so that dark-morphs like Sawhat, Dibbuk and Djinn don’t get a hold on your soul. Traveling on the Song Trails helps, according to local belief.</p>\n<p>Among the faithful who do not believe in the danger of darkness, legends of the space creatures abound, telling of lifeforms from outer space preying on travellers. Others believe that these are sentient space organisms created by crazy scientists and biosculptors from Ahalimm or maybe even by the extinct Founders. Clearly, some of the space creatures sighted were asteroids or Hadra clouds. Yet, time and time again abandoned ships are found with damage to the hull that could not be explained...</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"uNLbT9f58U6kVeBg":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.5n72u65DSgRIeCiG"}},"_id":"RkBsPUHjuqHcb4Gt"}

{"name":"The History of the Rimward Reach","content":"<h1>The History of the Rimward Reach</h1>\n<p>Just over three centuries ago, the area near the Kandah cloud was colonized for the first time. An asteroid station was built next to the cloud, and all around, smaller outposts sprouted. The identity of these intrepid colonizers and their reason for settling in such an inhospitable place is still a matter of dispute amongst academics. Yet, an even greater mystery is their sudden disappearance. Archaeological investigations show that the first colonists vanished from the area virtually overnight. They left behind a band of stations and abandoned ships that are a monument to a bygone civilization.</p>\n<p>Following their disappearance, the Rimward Reach was once again forgotten. For a long time, only smugglers went all the way out to Transshura, building small bases to hide beyond the long arm of the law. Over 30 years ago, the Foundation sent a deep probe to the area. The sensor data surprised the researchers on Coriolis. Readouts that had been interpreted as a common asteroid cluster turned out to be a series of advanced shipwrecks.</p>\n<p>What happened next would decisively shape the future of the Rimward Reach. The Consortium decided that the find was not important enough for a fully funded expedition and decided to grant permits and funding for private expeditions to the area instead. Two cutters - Holy Amesia and Volos - left under Captain Antoli Djachroum and soon found the remnants of a former civilization that had once thrived in the Reach. When the expedition rediscovered the asteroid station on the edge of the Kandah cloud, it was quickly claimed by Captain Djachroum and declared free and independent from the Consortium and other factions of the Third Horizon. Since that day, the Reach has been a popular with wreck hunters, prospectors, and dissidents.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the re-colonialization of the abandoned space station, a group of prospectors belonging to the Free League discovered the existence of a previously unknown mineral in the Kandah Cloud. At first it was thought to be Selidium, a substance used in the construction of graviton projectors. However, this new substance proved to be much more potent than Selidium. The precious mineral was named Maghdan after the researcher Ariste Maghdan and caused a veritable gold rush among Kuan prospectors.</p>\n<p>Over the ensuing years, the Rimward Reach filled with fortune seekers. The asteroid station, now called Djachroum, became a natural hub and gathering place for all new arrivals. Swiftly, the Foundation also established an astronomical research station and an archaeological unit and when the treasure hunters and ruin looters swarmed the area, the Legion was called in to patrol. To establish a base for their patrols and to project their power close to the Maghdan deposits, they also built a smaller research and service outpost for the Legion, the base known as Thalus.</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"uNLbT9f58U6kVeBg":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.coriolis-djachroum-rimward-reach.rimward_journals.FW51p4P4vZS1SYnx"}},"_id":"YBTyJdGXUck1llIn"}
{"name":"Conflicts","content":"<h1>Conflicts</h1>\n<p>The precarious balance of power between Reach groupings and factions has accelerated a series of conflicts in the region. The discovery of the potent mineral Maghdan is an important factor, but in the crucible of interests that have accumulated in the Reach in recent years, many conflicts intermingle.</p>\n<h2>The Marrab Conflict</h2>\n<p>The great conflict that permeates the Reach today is the low-intensity war between prospector clans and the Nomads' swarms. At its heart lie the disputed rights to the valuable Maghdan deposits found in the Marrab cluster.</p>\n<p>When the prospector clans began to search for Maghdan around the Kandah cloud, they used several of the region's asteroids as bases. Initially, this went tolerably well but one day one group of prospectors from the clan Yimon found high concentrations of Maghdan around the asteroid Marrab. This asteroid was considered sacred by the Nomads and had long served as a meeting place and residence for the swarms. The nomads did not allow mining at Marrab and when hot-headed prospectors from Yimon still tried, their ship and mining drone were shot down.</p>\n<p>The clans immediately retaliated, supported by the Consortium and the Legion. Nomad settlements were attacked and destroyed. The swarms of the nomads gathered in the dark emptiness between Kandah and the asteroid cluster and held their council.</p>\n<p>After protracted discussions and the withdrawal of the smallest swarm Badjao from the discussions, the swarms decided to strike back. In a sudden attack on the newly created exploration base Nexis, this main outpost of the clans was destroyed, along with ships, smelters and mining drones worth enormous sums. The nomads were careful to avoid shooting the residential sectors at Nexis, but as happens so often in the heat of the battle, a whole housing sector including a school was damaged and vented to the vacuum. The Marrab conflict had started.</p>\n<h2>The Silent War</h2>\n<p>It is no secret that the conflict between the nomads and the prospecting clans has gone beyond than Maghdan deposits around Marrab. Both sides have powerful allies who have their own motives for winning the conflict. Some prospectors receive financial assistance and access to advanced technology from the Consortium and weapons systems from the Legion.</p>\n<p>The nomads, for their part, are supported by Djachroum, their source of supplies, weapons, and ships. This power struggle has been named “The Silent War” and is being watched with keen curiosity by countless spies from the other Horizon factions.</p>\n<h2>Corsair Problem</h2>\n<p>Lawless bands of Corsairs have been a problem in the Reach ever since the area was rediscovered During the last two years, the raids have multiplied and are now having an impact on the Reach’s economy, which relies heavily on imports. In order to curb the attacks, the Free League and Djachroum have hired Corsair hunters from all over the Horizon, including the renowned Djadir Chartou, who had earlier wiped out the Crusaders in Awadhi's Azure cluster. The Legion has also expanded its patrols in the area around Thalus and along Colonial Agency routes and their trade station Khea. There are many theories about why the corsairs have become increasingly aggressive and skilled in their raids. Some speculate that the Syndicate is behind it all, others that it is an elaborate Legion conspiracy to provide an excuse for increasing their military presence in the area.</p>\n<h2>Kuan Expansion</h2>\n<p>After their recent expansion into the Rimward Reach, the Consortium and Legion presence has raised the stakes, even though direct confrontations have been avoided so far. In recent segments, the Legion strengthened their positions significantly. It started with the faction's warships creating a defence perimeter around the Firstcome Armada, taking even their allies in the Foundation by surprise. Now, stubborn rumours are circulating that a bulk carrier under heavy escort is about to enter fleet base Thalus. Observers at Djachroum agree that something big is brewing. The question is what it might be?</p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"uNLbT9f58U6kVeBg":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.OZ3eXYzsfiEjYJJX"}},"_id":"Z1VNlxPpcAQgpNag"}
{"name":"Places in the Rimward Reach","content":"<h1>Places in the Rimward Reach</h1>\n<p>In addition to the asteroid station Djachroum, the Legion's fleet base Thalus, the Colonial Agency’s Khea Trading Station and the Bulletin Station Karhal7, the Rimward Reach is filled with unexplored places shrouded in historical mystery. Many of these are governed by local rulers or other groups.</p>\n<h2>The Marrab Cluster</h2>\n<p>The Marrab cluster consists of the five major asteroids: Marrab, Nija, Hraub, Dakka and Rayyan. It is at the heart of a conflict that threatens to divide the Reach.</p>\n<h3>Marrab</h3>\n<p>Marrab, about the size of the smallest of Surha's moons, has been a sacred place for the nomads since ancient times. Just like Surha’s moons, Marrab has a thin but poisonous atmosphere.</p>\n<p>The asteroid is used as a meeting place for the various swarms of the Reach, which gather there during The Traveller’s segment to exchange knowledge, songs and celebrate marriages between families in the various swarms. In the past, there were several settlements on Marrab, most of them by the lost Ahilar swarm. The war has changed that. Now there are only a few well-defended settlements and some illegal nomadic settlements and clan bases.</p>\n<p>The Legion and Djachroum both have banned the establishment of new colonies, a ban that is not always adhered to. The only permitted landing spot is the holy dome of Marrab-dhul, which is managed by a supervisory group from the various swarms. Previously, the oasis was open to travellers, asteroid walkers, and traders, but when the fighting began, it was closed to all but nomads. Above Marrab-dhul patrols a lone old torpedo boat belonging to the Legion, closely accompanied by Swarm Mehtar's three fastest ships. Its official mission is to protect the oasis from the clans, but the nomads suspect that it is not the whole truth.</p>\n<h3>Missing Torpedo Boat Akula</h3>\n<p>Legion captain Nhirma has been given the responsibility to establish a neutral zone around Marrab-dhul. The mission would usually be seen as a dismal career move, but the captain enjoys the tranquillity of Marrab. The torpedo boat Akula she commands has only one other crew member, technician and jack-of-all-trades Ebi.</p>\n<p>She is on good terms with the abbess on Marrabdhul's Madrassa, Hithna. One day when the Icons turned their gaze from the Akula, a black birr struck the ship. The ship was badly damaged, and Captain Nihrma had to request the help of the escorting Mehtar ships. The captain and Ebi transferred to helping the ships and were put in confinement while the nomad captain Ardalan Gath-Chitral promised to repair their ship. Two days later, Captain Nirhma was released at the airlock to Marrab-dhul. An apologetic Hithna says that unfortunately, the ship and its complement of torpedoes was lost without further explanation.</p>\n<h3>Rayyan &amp; Prospector Base Nexis</h3>\n<p>On Rayyan lies the prospector clan's main base and hub, Nexis. Nexis base consists of a cave complex drilled deep into the asteroid. On the surface, there are numerous cylindrical melting furnaces and a large space port serving trawlers, mobile smelting vessels, mining drones and passing free traders. The base has been hit hard by the conflict and has had quite a downturn. A lack of maintenance has taken its toll and decay is becoming apparent. Only work crews, some administrative staff and the leaders of the clan remain. Most families of the Baianos-Neved clan have chosen to leave the base and live instead in smaller dome and grotto bases.</p>\n<p>Some surface areas of the asteroid are covered by peculiar vacuum organisms as the weak light from distant Kua transforms the asteroid's matter into different substances and pure energy. The organisms are said to have been created by the scientist Wahina during the time that swarm Ahilar had settled here. (see “The Truth about Station 18” to find out more about Wahina). Could they be related to the “Ahilar’s Curse”?</p>\n<h3>Ahilar's Last Prophet</h3>\n<p>No more children are born on Nexis. In the beginning, this curse only afflicted the base itself, but over the last couple of years, no children have been born in the outlying habitats either.</p>\n<p>Famous doctors, scientists and bio sculptors have been called in, but so far have not found a cause or a cure. People are in good physical health. Many people have tried to leave the asteroid, dark diseases ravage the minds and the Maghdan extraction has all but dried up. Recently, the preacher Amon arrived at Nexis. He preaches that a curse has been cast over the asteroid by the Ahilar Swarm before it vanished.</p>\n<p>Unholy spirits brought by the curse – dark-morphs - mean that no new life can be brought forth. Only by bringing Ahilar's blood back to the asteroid can the curse be broken. Even if the Ahilar had remained in the Reach, this would be unthinkable to most. But Yawin Neved, son of clan leader Gavdro, believes Amon. Ignoring the clan’s abuse of the swarms so far, he is now determined to find a surviving Ahilar.</p>\n<p>After persuading the asteroid walker Nguna to join his expedition, he leaves Nexis on the “Horizon's Dream”. At first, the journey goes well but when passing near Marrab-duhl, all systems fail. When their sensors come back to life, the ship is about to exit the cluster, yet their surroundings look different to their navigation charts.</p>\n<h3>Dakka 3</h3>\n<p>The endpoint of the open war in the Marrab conflict was the massacre at the Ahilar oasis on Dakka 3, a retaliatory attack following the assault on Nexis. The Dakka asteroid consists of three large crater valleys and resembles a hollowed-out coral.</p>\n<p>Before the conflict with the clans, there were several oases tended by the Ahilar swarm, whose population was mostly sedentary. The massacre devastated the entire asteroid with repeated bombings and today none of its oases remain. The vacuum organisms that grew in them have quickly expanded and morphed into new forms. Now they cover virtually the entire asteroid and only occasional remnants of Ahilar’s minarets protrude from the mass of growth. Sometimes, a whole clump of the algae-like organism drifts away, propelled by a gossamer-thin sun sail.</p>\n<p>Whenever the clans or the swarms encounter such a flying organism, they make sure to destroy it.</p>\n<h3>The Opposite of Stowaway</h3>\n<p>Free trader Farhad considers himself an impartial man. He sells everything and delivers everything to everyone, be it weapons, refugees or frozen goats. He has just been awarded a lucrative contract to pick up an extremely sensitive cargo in the Marrab cluster. Something that requires his best ship, Saijan, and its functioning hangar. Farhad is nervous. His mysterious client boarded the ship at Ahalimm but has since hidden in his cabin. The client requires fast delivery of the goods to coordinates near the gravitation tarns. The loading of the cargo was swiftly done, but then things start to go wrong. The client seems to have disappeared from the ship and crew have died in strange ways. A warship has detected that he is sneaking around the Marrab cluster and is clearly suspicious. Farhad broadcasts an emergency signal and sets a course for the nearest clan base.</p>\n<h2>Monastery Sofia Gora</h2>\n<p>Almost as far out as you can get before the interstellar darkness begins, the Monastery Sofia Gora and its famous archives are found. The origins of the monastery are shrouded in mystery, perhaps it was built before the Founders arrived in the Rimward Reach?</p>\n<p>The monastery is located on an asteroid which slowly wanders through the sector of the Lady of Tears and approaches the sector of the Faceless on its path towards the inner system. It is said that one day it will crash into Kua and all the wisdom collected in its archives will be lost. Everyone is welcome at the monastery in the search of knowledge and enlightenment. The only condition is that they bring some new knowledge with them to add to its archives. Only once this gift has been accepted by the monks are visitors allowed to access the archives.</p>\n<p>Most strikingly, the first thing visitors see of the monastery is Hazruman's mosaic, a big mosaic window that faces Kua's dim and distant light. The window is a complicated mosaic of countless glass panes, none of which are exactly the same shape. It was created by the long-gone monk Hazruman, as a tribute to the diversity and unpredictability of the universe. Nobody knows for sure what it represents. Its meaning seems to be in the eye of the beholder. Many travelled here to meditate in front of the window, and many experienced visions.</p>\n<p>When polishing the window as his daily duty, the monk Azran now has the company of the corpulent mathematician Izrahan Addilad from Coriolis. This genius of numbers attempts to examine every mosaic pane with his advanced light spectrometer to find a key to its design and meaning. Although his studies are intense and wide ranging, the key to the window’s secret has so far eluded him.</p>\n<p>The monastery itself consists of nine domed buildings, partially built into the asteroid. The largest dome houses the other peculiarity of the monastery: a beautiful arboretum, a forest hall. Well-pruned trees grow in the hall, in what seems at first sight to be a chaotic confusion. The monks usually gather here for philosophical discussions and meditation when they are not working in the archives or performing their daily chores.</p>\n<h2>The Mining Baron’s Palace</h2>\n<p>On the edge of Ashala's asteroid belt lies the asteroid D14-465, one of many asteroids of smaller type in the area. As Maghdan is rare in the area, the asteroid would be forgotten, were it not for the strange building which was discovered by chance ten years ago. Archaeologists reckon that the palace-like structure was constructed just over two centuries ago, that is, during a period when the Rimward Reach was deemed forgotten and uninhabited. The interior of the building has long been open to vacuum and picked clean by looters, so little evidence of its former occupants has been found.</p>\n<p>The palace is not the only remnant on the asteroid. In a radius of several kilometres stand three colossal vehicles, kitted out in what looks like exploration drilling equipment, seemingly abandoned in the middle of a work shift. This discovery has led to the common people calling the structure the Mining Baron’s palace, even though no one knows for sure who built it and what they were looking for on the asteroid.</p>\n<h3>Ateos Miniature</h3>\n<p>The Nasar and antique collector Ateo Vadat has a deal with the nomadic swarm Mehtar, who came across a remarkable find: a beautifully sculpted bronze sculpture by the Algol sculptor Koavein. The miniature shows the mining baron's palace and strangely enough, the model seems to contain an intricate clockwork that has long stopped. Was Koavein really from Algol and what does his miniature hide?</p>\n<h2>Archaeological Field Station Djerid</h2>\n<p>Close to the Armada of the Firstcome, there is station Djerid, a small outpost hosting twelve field archaeologists from the Foundation's Archaeological Institute.</p>\n<p>The main purpose of the station is to study the old ships in the armada using remote sensors, probes and even space walks. Until recently, Doctor Wana and her small group systematically mapped out the abandoned fleet, boarding the ships one by one and mapping and examining their interior.</p>\n<p>The other major project that the archaeologists at Djerid are working on is laconically called Excavation Unit 13: a settlement more than 350 years old on a nearby unnamed asteroid. The settlement is extremely unusual as it seems that the Founders left partly intact databases behind. Currently, three archaeologists are stationed at the excavation and are trying to find a key to the more than three centuries old encryption. If they succeeded, it would be nothing short of a scientific sensation.</p>\n<h3>The Armada of the Firstcome</h3>\n<p>One of the greatest mysteries the Founders left behind is the group of shipwrecks known as the Armada of the Firstcome - hundreds of shipwrecks in eerily perfect rows. Some seem to have disabled though operational systems. The researchers from Djerid are still puzzled by the incomprehensible encryption that protects their dormant systems. It is almost as if the slumbering giants were just waiting for their masters’ return. Some time ago, the Legion banned all traffic around the Armada and established a blockade. Why have they become so protective of the old hulks? Maybe they succeded where the ship archaeologists failed?</p>\n<h2>The Kander-Malls Observatory</h2>\n<p>The Kander-Malls Institute for Astronomical Observations houses about fifty researchers studying the strange phenomena known in public as the gravitation tarns. The observatory is a collaboration with a delegation of astronics from the Foundation and a private consortium consisting of researchers and technicians from Djachroum, funded by Nasar princes Gulbanu. It is located in a modified space station of an elderly type divided into a housing module and a research module.</p>\n<p>The observatory is often cited as an example of peaceful cooperation between Djachroum and the Consortium and that is true to some extent. Yet, the “silent war” (the conflict between Swarms and Clans) is also present here. Both groups have agents among the staff and in the last segment, a number of strange accidents have occurred.</p>\n<h3>Project Midas</h3>\n<p>After several probes were successfully sent into the area around the gravitational tarns, the observatory has started Project Midas. Its goal: sending a manned probe into the tarns. The composition of the five strong crew of the Midas capsule has become a prestige issue at the station.</p>\n<p>Both groups need to be represented and many researchers want to crown their careers by making scientific history. One of them is the astronomer Souray Houri, head of the Foundation's scientific delegation and a man who is obsessed with solving the mystery of the Tarns. Materials specialists Jana rad-Wouli from the Djachroum delegation is determined that the majority of the crew should come from her group.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"uNLbT9f58U6kVeBg":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.e5RaWLdgW7g1z5mZ"}},"_id":"xrISbPVYgR8CyQXw"}
